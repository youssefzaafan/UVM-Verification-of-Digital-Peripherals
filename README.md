# 🔬 UVM Verification Projects Collection

This repository serves as a **central hub** for all my UVM-based verification projects.  
It showcases different protocol verifications and digital design testbenches implemented in **SystemVerilog** using the **UVM methodology**.

Each project demonstrates:
- Building scalable UVM testbenches.
- Transaction-level modeling (Driver, Monitor, Scoreboard, Subscriber, Coverage).
- Verification of digital protocols and memory designs.
- Emphasis on **constrained-random verification** and **coverage-driven methodology**.
